# Resharper.AutoFormatOnSave

Resharper.AutoFormatOnSave is a Visual Studio Extension that calls ReSharper's `Silent Cleanup Code` command when you save your solution.

## Allowed File Extensions

If you don't want to execute the command for a specific file extension, you can change the allowed file extensions.

To do this you have to open `Tools`->`Options` and go to the category `ReSharper.AutoFormatOnSave`. Under `Allowed File Extensions` you can now disallow a specific file extension by setting it's value to `false`.
